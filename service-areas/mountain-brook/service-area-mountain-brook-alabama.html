      <p>
        Every <strong>custom home in Mountain Brook, Alabama</strong> begins with an understanding of its setting—gentle slopes,
        winding drives, and tree-lined streets that shape daily life. <strong>Riveroak Building Company</strong> has spent years
        building relationships with local <strong>HOAs, arborists, and architectural review boards</strong> to ensure that each
        residence enhances its surroundings while meeting Mountain Brook’s high standards for design, preservation, and beauty.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the charm of <strong>English Village</strong> townhomes to the grandeur of <strong>Cherokee Bend</strong> estates,
        every Riveroak project balances architecture with landscape. We manage <strong>site grading, drainage, hardscaping,
        and outdoor living design</strong> so your home feels naturally placed—never imposed. Inside, you’ll find curated
        materials, layered lighting, and thoughtful spatial flow that reflect both elegance and ease.
      </p>
