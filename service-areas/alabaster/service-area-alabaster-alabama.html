        <h2>Connected to Birmingham. Rooted in Shelby County charm.</h2>
      </div>

      <p>
        Just twenty-five minutes south of downtown Birmingham, <strong>Alabaster, Alabama (35007)</strong> balances small-town warmth with metropolitan access.
        Winding through <strong>I-65</strong> and <strong>Highway 31</strong>, the city is surrounded by wooded hillsides, parks, and well-established neighborhoods that invite thoughtful design and comfortable living. 
        From family-friendly communities like Weatherly and Navajo Hills to emerging developments near Veterans Park, Alabaster offers diverse opportunities for <strong>custom home construction</strong> and refined renovation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Riveroak Building Company</strong> partners with homeowners who value detail, transparency, and a home that reflects their lifestyle.
        Our <strong>design-build process</strong> integrates architecture, engineering, and craftsmanship—so each home feels individually composed while remaining harmonious with its environment. 
        We plan each project around its <strong>site conditions, sun orientation, drainage patterns, and views</strong>, ensuring lasting beauty and structural integrity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alabaster’s growth brings new opportunities, but also requires experience with its <strong>Shelby County permitting systems, neighborhood covenants, and HOA review processes</strong>.
        Riveroak coordinates these details on your behalf, maintaining progress while protecting architectural intent. 
        Whether your goal is a modern farmhouse on a wooded lot or a transitional estate near the city’s center, our process delivers balance—between timeless design and modern livability.
      </p>

      <p>
        With every build, we remain true to our core promise: <strong>Honest. Fair. Reliable.</strong> From feasibility studies to final walk-throughs, we manage every phase with clarity and respect, ensuring your Alabaster home becomes part of the area’s legacy of craftsmanship and care.

          <p itemprop="text">
            The price of building a <strong>custom home in Alabaster, Alabama (35007)</strong> depends on a variety of factors—including <strong>lot topography</strong>, 
            <strong>soil conditions</strong>, <strong>utility access</strong>, and the <strong>architectural style and finishes</strong> you select. 
            Riveroak Building Company conducts an in-person site evaluation to identify grade, drainage, and connection points before delivering 
            a <strong>comprehensive, transparent estimate</strong>. Our process ensures accurate pricing for excavation, framing, and design features 
            while aligning every detail with your budget and vision.
