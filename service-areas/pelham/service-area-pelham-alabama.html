        <h2>Rooted in the neighborhoods and natural beauty of Pelham.</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Building in <strong>Pelham, Alabama</strong> means working within a landscape that blends <strong>mountain views,
        forested neighborhoods, and family-oriented communities</strong>—each with its own character and building guidelines.
        From the golf-course greens of <strong>Ballantrae</strong> to the wooded slopes of <strong>Oak Mountain Estates</strong>,
        our team understands how to design homes that celebrate their surroundings while meeting <strong>HOA and city standards</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At <strong>Riveroak Building Company</strong>, we approach every project as a collaboration rooted in transparency,
        craftsmanship, and respect for the land. We navigate <strong>topography, drainage, and tree preservation plans</strong>
        with care—protecting mature oaks, waterways, and natural contours that define Pelham’s scenic identity. Our builders and
        designers coordinate with <strong>local review boards, inspectors, and neighborhood associations</strong> to ensure
        your home not only passes approvals but feels like it belongs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every <strong>Pelham custom home</strong> we build is designed for connection—between family, friends, and the outdoors.
        We create interiors with <strong>chef-inspired kitchens, spa-like primary suites, and light-filled gathering spaces</strong>
        that transition naturally to outdoor living areas. Picture evenings spent under vaulted porches, fireside patios, or
        poolside courtyards surrounded by the beauty of <strong>Shelby County’s rolling hills</strong>. Whether you’re
        establishing roots in <strong>Wild Timber</strong> or reimagining a lakeside home near <strong>Oak Mountain State Park</strong>,
        Riveroak ensures each detail reflects your lifestyle and the spirit of Pelham living.
