        <h2>Preserving Homewood’s hillside icon.</h2>
      </div>

      <p>
        Tucked along <strong>Shades Creek Parkway</strong> and framed by rolling hills, 
        <strong>Hollywood in Homewood, Alabama (35209)</strong> stands as one of Birmingham’s 
        most architecturally distinctive neighborhoods. Recognized for its 
        <strong>Spanish and Mediterranean Revival homes</strong> with red-clay tile roofs, 
        archways, and stucco facades, Hollywood’s charm lies in its timeless craftsmanship 
        and lush, tree-lined streets. Listed on the <strong>National Register of Historic Places</strong>, 
        this enclave embodies old-world elegance balanced with proximity to modern convenience — 
        moments from <strong>SoHo Square</strong>, <strong>Samford University</strong>, and downtown Birmingham.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Riveroak Building Company</strong> serves as a trusted partner for homeowners seeking to 
        enhance or reimagine these celebrated properties. As an experienced 
        <strong>Homewood custom home builder</strong>, we navigate <strong>historic preservation guidelines, 
        steep elevations, and tight lot constraints</strong> with precision and care. From 
        <strong>ground-up construction</strong> to <strong>whole-home restorations</strong>, we choreograph 
        every stage — zoning, permitting, structural planning, and fine detailing — to create homes that 
        feel both authentically Hollywood and undeniably yours.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every Riveroak project blends <strong>luxury design, heritage respect, and structural integrity</strong>. 
        We coordinate with <strong>local architects, artisans, and inspectors</strong> to ensure each residence 
        reflects the neighborhood’s Mediterranean soul while performing beautifully for modern living. 
        Whether restoring a 1920s estate or introducing a new hillside retreat, our work honors Hollywood’s 
        legacy — one detail, one arch, one handcrafted finish at a time.

      <p>
        Nestled within the <strong>35209 ZIP code</strong>, <strong>Hollywood in Homewood, Alabama</strong> blends hillside views,
        Mediterranean architecture, and a sense of timeless refinement just minutes from <strong>Downtown Birmingham</strong>.
        Originally developed in the 1920s as a Spanish-inspired retreat, this historic neighborhood sits gracefully between
        <strong>Mountain Brook</strong> and <strong>Shades Creek</strong>, offering proximity to <strong>SoHo Square</strong>,
        <strong>Brookwood Village</strong>, and the scenic <strong>Shades Creek Greenway</strong>. Clay-tiled roofs and arched
        porticos line <strong>Hollywood Boulevard</strong>, while winding, tree-canopied side streets reveal cottages and villas
        that showcase the area’s cinematic charm.

      <p>
        <strong>Riveroak Building Company</strong> approaches every Hollywood project with the respect this district deserves.

        the tranquility and elegance residents cherish. Our team works hand-in-hand with <strong>Homewood City Hall</strong>,
        <strong>Jefferson County inspectors</strong>, and neighborhood associations to navigate permitting, stormwater
        guidelines, and architectural reviews with ease.
      </p>

      <p>
        From <strong>artisan plasterwork</strong> and <strong>hand-forged iron railings</strong> to <strong>custom hardwood
        cabinetry</strong> and <strong>terracotta finishes</strong>, Riveroak curates materials that complement Hollywood’s
        architectural narrative while enhancing daily life. The result is a home that feels authentic, enduring, and
        unmistakably rooted in this iconic Homewood enclave.

          <p itemprop="text">
            Homebuilding and renovation costs in <strong>Hollywood, Homewood (35209)</strong> depend on factors like 
            <strong>lot elevation, architectural detailing, and preservation requirements</strong>. Historic stucco and tile homes 
            often involve specialized materials and artisanship to ensure period accuracy. After your on-site consultation, 
            <strong>Riveroak Building Company</strong> provides a detailed proposal outlining <strong>investment ranges, allowances, 
            milestone phases, and finish options</strong>—so you can plan with clarity and confidence from the very beginning.
