            <h2>Walkable charm, livable design, handcrafted for generations.</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            <strong>Homewood, AL</strong> balances small-town warmth with Birmingham convenience. Edgewood’s bungalow-lined
            streets, Hollywood’s Spanish Revival estates, and the energy of downtown Homewood make it a destination for families
            who value community, schools, and quick commutes. Every home tells a story—and every renovation deserves thoughtful
            stewardship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Riveroak Building Company creates homes that celebrate that story. Whether we are expanding a cottage near Homewood
            Central Park or rebuilding a hillside property overlooking Shades Creek, our design–build team manages zoning,
            permitting, and construction logistics on tight lots so you can focus on life in the heart of Homewood.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a trusted <strong>Homewood luxury home builder</strong>, we prioritize natural light, indoor–outdoor flow, and
            curated finishes that feel timeless from day one. Expect a guided experience with transparent budgets, collaborative
            selections, and weekly updates from start to finish.

        <h2>Rooted in Homewood’s parks, porches, and vibrant village life.</h2>
      </div>

      <p>
        Every <strong>Homewood custom home project</strong> begins with an understanding of what makes this community so special—
        walkable streets, friendly neighbors, and an energy that flows from its parks and porches. The city’s charm stretches
        from <strong>Patriot Park</strong> and <strong>Homewood Central Park</strong> to the boutiques and cafés of
        <strong>SoHo Square</strong> and <strong>18th Street South</strong>. Families stroll to <strong>Edgewood Elementary</strong>,
        jog along the <strong>Shades Creek Greenway</strong>, and gather for football weekends near <strong>Samford University</strong>,
        creating a lifestyle that’s as connected as it is relaxed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Riveroak Building Company</strong> designs each home around those rhythms—balancing architectural heritage with
        modern function. We plan construction schedules around school hours and neighborhood events, coordinate deliveries for
        <strong>narrow, tree-lined streets</strong>, and protect the oaks and maples that define Homewood’s canopy. Whether
        <strong>renovating a 1920s Edgewood cottage</strong> or designing a new <strong>family retreat near Lakeshore Drive</strong>,
        our process is anchored in respect for the community and the people who call it home.
      </p>

      <p>
        Riveroak’s network of <strong>Birmingham artisans</strong>—cabinetmakers, millworkers, landscape designers, and
        preservation experts—ensures that every home reflects <strong>Homewood’s architectural identity</strong> while meeting
        the needs of today’s families. From custom millwork and chef-grade kitchens to screened porches and integrated outdoor
        living spaces, every detail is thoughtfully curated to bring your vision to life with authenticity and care.

        <h3 itemprop="name">What influences the cost of a custom home in Homewood?</h3>
        <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
          <p itemprop="text">
            In <strong>Homewood, Alabama (35209)</strong>, the cost of a custom home depends on several key factors—such as
            <strong>lot size, topography, existing infrastructure, and architectural complexity</strong>. Narrow infill lots in
            Edgewood or Mayfair, for example, often require precision excavation and foundation work, while larger parcels in
            Hollywood or Lakewood allow more design flexibility. Riveroak begins each project with a detailed on-site review and
            transparent proposal outlining <strong>site preparation, utilities, framing, and finish selections</strong> so you can
            invest confidently and avoid unexpected costs.

        <h3 itemprop="name">Can Riveroak help with historic Homewood renovations?</h3>
        <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
          <p itemprop="text">
            Yes—and it’s one of our specialties. Riveroak has extensive experience restoring <strong>historic Homewood
            architecture</strong>, from <strong>Edgewood Craftsman cottages</strong> and <strong>Hollywood Spanish Revivals</strong> to
            English Tudor and mid-century homes along <strong>Oxmoor Road</strong> and <strong>Mecca Avenue</strong>. We work closely
            with the <strong>City of Homewood’s Design Review Committee</strong> to ensure that each renovation respects original
            proportions and materials while introducing <strong>modern amenities, energy efficiency, and comfort</strong>. The goal:
            a revitalized home that keeps its soul while meeting today’s standards.

        <h3 itemprop="name">Do you manage permits, neighborhood approvals, and inspections?</h3>
        <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
          <p itemprop="text">
            Absolutely. Riveroak manages every aspect of <strong>Homewood permitting</strong> and <strong>Jefferson County
            inspections</strong>, including <strong>HOA and architectural review board coordination</strong> for neighborhoods like
            <strong>Mayfair, Grove Park, Hollywood, and Edgewood</strong>. Our team understands setback limits, tree preservation
            requirements, and stormwater guidelines unique to Homewood. From drawings to approvals, we streamline communication with
            city departments so your project progresses smoothly and stays compliant.

        <h3 itemprop="name">Do you take on additions, remodels, and outdoor living projects?</h3>
        <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
          <p itemprop="text">
            We do. Homewood families often look to expand without moving, and Riveroak helps make that possible through
            <strong>second-story additions</strong>, <strong>garage apartments</strong>, and <strong>whole-home remodels</strong> that
            integrate beautifully with the neighborhood’s established charm. Our outdoor projects—like <strong>screened porches,
            patios, fireplaces, and kitchens</strong>—extend living spaces year-round and complement the walkable, family-centered
            Homewood lifestyle. Every plan is tailored for comfort, durability, and architectural harmony.

        <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
          <p itemprop="text">
            Homewood is more than a service area for us—it’s a community we know personally. Riveroak is a
            <strong>local, design–build firm</strong> that values clear communication, architectural integrity, and long-term
            relationships. Our clients appreciate that we handle everything—from design concept and selections to final inspection—

            new residence near <strong>Homewood Central Park</strong>, we make the process organized, transparent, and enjoyable.
