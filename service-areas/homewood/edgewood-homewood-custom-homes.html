        <h2>Homewood’s heart for neighborhood living.</h2>
      </div>

      <p>
        In the heart of <strong>Homewood, Alabama (35209)</strong>, <strong>Edgewood</strong> captures the best of southern
        neighborhood life—tree-lined streets, timeless architecture, and a deep sense of community. Children walk to
        <strong>Edgewood Elementary School</strong>, families gather on front porches, and neighbors meet at
        <strong>Edgewood Village</strong> for coffee, fresh pastries, and seasonal parades that fill Oxmoor Road with music
        and laughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Architectural styles here range from <strong>1920s brick bungalows</strong> and <strong>Tudor cottages</strong> to
        thoughtfully expanded homes that blend classic character with modern comfort. Each property tells its own story—and
        Riveroak Building Company helps write the next chapter through <strong>custom design–build solutions</strong> that
        respect Edgewood’s scale, history, and charm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you’re <strong>renovating a historic kitchen</strong>, <strong>adding a new primary suite</strong>, or
        <strong>building a custom home from the ground up</strong>, Riveroak guides you through every phase with honesty,
        craftsmanship, and care. We’re local builders who know <strong>Homewood’s permitting process, architectural
        guidelines, and neighborhood expectations</strong>—ensuring your project moves smoothly from concept to completion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Expect <strong>responsive communication, curated material selections, and a collaborative process</strong> led by a
        team that values both precision and personality. Our goal is simple: to create a home that fits your family’s rhythm
        and feels right at home in Edgewood’s enduring landscape.

        <h2>Life along Edgewood’s tree-lined avenues.</h2>
      </div>

      <p>
        Nestled in the heart of <strong>Homewood, Alabama (35209)</strong>, Edgewood blends small-town warmth with the
        energy of Birmingham’s close-knit suburbs. Tree-canopied streets, friendly sidewalks, and historic homes
        surround <strong>Oxmoor Road</strong>, <strong>Lakeshore Drive</strong>, and the <strong>Shades Creek Greenway</strong>—creating one of
        the most walkable and welcoming neighborhoods in Jefferson County.
      </p>

      <p>
        On any given weekend, families walk or bike to <strong>Edgewood Village</strong> for coffee and local boutiques, gather
        at <strong>Homewood Central Park</strong> for community events, or visit the Saturday <strong>Homewood Farmers Market</strong>.
        The neighborhood’s charm lies in its character—classic architecture, mature trees, and an unmistakable sense of
        connection—all just minutes from <strong>downtown Birmingham</strong> and <strong>UAB</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Riveroak Building Company partners with homeowners who want to honor Edgewood’s historic fabric while embracing
        modern living. Projects often include <strong>home additions, basement conversions, kitchen expansions, and outdoor
        living retreats</strong>. Our team navigates <strong>Homewood’s zoning codes, design guidelines, and stormwater
        requirements</strong> with precision—coordinating with inspectors and keeping neighbors informed at every stage.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result is a refined home that feels authentically <strong>Edgewood</strong>: grounded in its timeless character yet
        refreshed for today’s lifestyle—proof that craftsmanship, communication, and care never go out of style.

        <h3 itemprop="name">What’s the typical timeline for an Edgewood renovation?</h3>

          <p itemprop="text">
            Most <strong>Edgewood renovations</strong> follow a predictable rhythm, shaped by project size, permitting, and design complexity.
            After your in-home consultation, <strong>Riveroak Building Company</strong> prepares a detailed roadmap—from design development
            and <strong>Homewood permit approvals</strong> to construction milestones and finishing touches. Typical projects range from
            12–20 weeks for kitchens or additions to 6–9 months for larger whole-home transformations. Throughout every phase,
            you’ll receive clear progress updates and a transparent schedule so there are no surprises along the way.

        <h3 itemprop="name">Can Riveroak expand my Edgewood cottage without losing its charm?</h3>
        <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
          <p itemprop="text">
            Absolutely. Preserving <strong>Edgewood’s historic character</strong> is at the heart of what we do. Whether you’re adding a
            second story, a family room, or an outdoor living space, we carefully match <strong>brickwork, trim details, rooflines,
            and window proportions</strong> to ensure your new addition feels authentic—like it’s always been part of the home.
            Our design–build approach respects Homewood’s architectural guidelines while enhancing comfort, functionality,
            and long-term value.

        <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
          <p itemprop="text">
            Yes. Riveroak provides a <strong>concierge-level design experience</strong>—helping you choose cabinetry, tile, fixtures,
            flooring, and color palettes that complement your home’s character. Many of our clients also partner with
            interior designers, and we seamlessly coordinate that collaboration. From <strong>curated finish selections</strong>
            to furniture placement, we make sure every space—from the kitchen island to the back porch—feels intentional and inspired.

            We do. Riveroak manages every aspect of <strong>Homewood permitting, Jefferson County inspections, and architectural review</strong>
            to keep your project compliant and on schedule. Our team’s familiarity with <strong>Edgewood’s zoning, lot coverage, and stormwater regulations</strong>
            ensures a streamlined process and peace of mind from day one. You can trust that every detail—from paperwork to final inspection—
            is handled with precision and transparency.

        <h3 itemprop="name">What makes Riveroak different from other Birmingham builders?</h3>
        <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
          <p itemprop="text">
            Our difference lies in our <strong>personalized design–build process</strong> and deep roots in the <strong>Homewood community</strong>.
            We treat each home as a partnership—balancing transparency, craftsmanship, and care from start to finish.
            With local trade partners, refined project management tools, and genuine communication, Riveroak delivers
            a homebuilding experience that’s as rewarding as the finished space itself.
