        <h2>Rooted in Hoover&rsquo;s lake communities, golf neighborhoods, and hillside views.</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Building a home in <strong>Hoover, Alabama</strong> requires a thoughtful approach and an experienced team that understands the city&rsquo;s
        <strong>architectural standards, neighborhood expectations, and terrain diversity</strong>. With multiple
        <strong>HOAs, architectural review boards, and dual-county regulations</strong> spanning Jefferson and Shelby Counties,
        each neighborhood has its own rhythm and requirements. <strong>Riveroak Building Company</strong> manages these details seamlessly—coordinating with city inspectors,
        HOA committees, and utility providers to keep your project moving efficiently from concept to completion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our expertise extends across <strong>Hoover&rsquo;s most desirable communities</strong>, including
        <strong>The Preserve, Lake Wilborn, Chace Lake, Greystone, and Ross Bridge</strong>. We design and construct homes that make
        the most of Hoover&rsquo;s topography—whether that means a walkout basement with lake views, a golf-course patio made for entertaining,
        or a hillside retreat surrounded by mature hardwoods. Each plan is custom-tailored to blend architectural sophistication with
        <strong>modern comfort, energy performance, and family function</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside, our homes celebrate the way people live today—with <strong>chef&rsquo;s kitchens, wine rooms, theater spaces,
        and seamless indoor-outdoor transitions</strong>. Outside, we craft gathering environments that reflect Hoover&rsquo;s Southern charm:
        pools edged with stonework, covered porches with vaulted ceilings, and curated landscaping that connects home and nature.

            Most <strong>custom homes in Hoover</strong> take between <strong>8–14 months</strong> from design through completion,
            depending on the complexity of the architecture, lot conditions, and permitting timeline. Our team manages each phase
            in-house&mdash;from site prep and foundation to final finishes&mdash;so your schedule stays realistic and transparent
            from day one.

          <p itemprop="text">
            Riveroak frequently builds in <strong>Greystone, Lake Wilborn, The Preserve, and Ross Bridge</strong>, where large
            lots, scenic landscapes, and well-defined HOA standards create a strong foundation for luxury homes. We also work on
            custom infill builds in <strong>Bluff Park</strong> and <strong>Riverchase</strong> for families looking to modernize
            established neighborhoods while maintaining character.

            craftsmanship, communication, and cost alignment in perfect balance.
