            <h2>Design that respects history while embracing the future.</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            Downtown and Southside Birmingham offer an inspiring backdrop for forward-thinking architecture—where history meets
            innovation. Riveroak builds high-end homes that celebrate light, space, and livability for discerning
            homeowners who crave both craftsmanship and convenience.
          </p>
          <p>
            From slender infill lots near Railroad Park to historic streets off Highland Avenue, we deliver tailored design-build
            services that respond to the rhythm of city life. Our team manages site planning, zoning, and structural detailing so
            your home performs beautifully in the heart of Birmingham.
          </p>
          <p>
            As your Downtown Birmingham custom home builder, we evaluate every parcel for views, privacy, and connection to
            neighborhood amenities such as Railroad Park, Regions Field, and Pepper Place. Thoughtful placement of courtyards,
            garages, and guest suites ensures your residence enhances both the streetscape and your day-to-day routine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Southside estates require a deep understanding of hillside lots, historic preservation, and modern comforts. We
            coordinate with trusted architects to deliver layered outdoor living, wellness retreats, and chef-inspired kitchens
            that honor Birmingham’s architectural legacy while introducing current technology and sustainable systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clients count on Riveroak for meticulous budgeting, proactive communication, and transparent timelines. From land
            acquisition studies to final punch list, we keep stakeholders informed and inspired, allowing you to focus on design
            choices that make your residence unmistakably yours.

            <h2>Intentional downtown architecture.</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            We collaborate with leading architects, interior designers, and artisans to produce homes that feel integrated with
            Birmingham’s cultural heartbeat. Clean lines, natural light, and innovative floor plans create spaces that entertain
            effortlessly and retreat quietly above the city.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our concierge project management keeps build timelines on track and neighbors informed, delivering a smooth experience
            from groundbreaking to move-in day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because sites near UAB and Five Points South often involve constrained access, we coordinate staging areas, delivery
            windows, and utility tie-ins with precision. You receive a dedicated project manager who anticipates questions from
            design review boards and homeowner associations while protecting your schedule.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every Riveroak residence is engineered for longevity with resilient building envelopes, smart-home integrations, and
            custom millwork produced by artisans who understand Birmingham’s climate. The result is a sophisticated retreat that
            supports entertaining, working from home, and wellness-focused living.

              <p itemprop="text">
                We analyze zoning, setbacks, and neighboring structures to create site-specific floor plans that maximize light,
                privacy, and skyline views. Structural partners help us integrate parking solutions, rooftop terraces, and
                modern systems within tight urban parcels.

                Yes. We frequently collaborate with the City of Birmingham Design Review Committee, neighborhood associations,
                and preservation groups. Our team prepares documentation, attends hearings, and navigates approvals while
                safeguarding your architectural vision.

                Absolutely. From loft conversions in historic warehouses to bespoke condominium interiors near Railroad Park, we
