            <h2>Rooted in the neighborhoods and natural beauty of Birmingham.</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            Our team understands the nuances of building in Birmingham—from coordinating with HOAs and historic overlays to
            protecting mature landscapes and waterways.
          </p>
          <p>
            We design homes that balance refined interiors with outdoor spaces made for gathering, ensuring your residence feels
            connected to the community and environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every project begins with on-site research into neighborhood history, architectural precedents, and the zoning
            language that shapes responsible growth. That deep familiarity with Birmingham’s fabric keeps your design aligned
            with both community expectations and your personal goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            From Red Mountain ridgelines to revitalized metropolitan infill, Riveroak keeps neighbors informed, jobsites orderly, and
            communication proactive throughout construction.
          </p>
          <p>
            We frequently collaborate with <strong>Birmingham architects and preservation boards</strong> to align design intent
            with community expectations. Whether your home overlooks <strong>Railroad Park</strong>, borders the <strong>Birmingham
            Botanical Gardens</strong>, or anchors a downtown streetscape, our team safeguards viewsheds, tree canopies, and the
            architectural identity that defines each enclave.

                Birmingham blends historic neighborhoods, steep lots, and metropolitan infill opportunities. We evaluate
                <strong>topography, drainage, and preservation guidelines</strong> for Red Mountain, Highland Park, and Forest
                Park sites so every project respects the architecture and landscape that make the Magic City special.

              <p itemprop="text">
                No. As a <strong>design–build partner</strong>, Riveroak guides you from initial concepts through finish
                selections. We can collaborate with your architect or assemble the right team to deliver drawings, engineering,
                and permitting that align with your goals and budget.

                Yes. We routinely coordinate with <strong>historic review boards, neighborhood associations, and zoning
                officials</strong> throughout Birmingham. Our team prepares documentation, attends meetings, and keeps the
                approval process organized so construction stays on schedule.

                Transparency is central to our process. We provide a detailed proposal with allowances, selections, and timeline
                milestones before work begins, then share <strong>weekly updates, site meetings, and budget tracking</strong> so
                you always know the status of your Birmingham home.
