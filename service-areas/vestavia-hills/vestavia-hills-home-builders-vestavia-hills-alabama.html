        <h2>Building with Vestavia Hills’ elevations, ordinances, and lifestyle in mind.</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        From the gated streets of <strong>Liberty Park</strong> to the wooded slopes along <strong>Rocky Ridge Road</strong> and
        <strong>Shades Crest</strong>, every <strong>Vestavia Hills homesite</strong> presents its own beauty—and its own challenges.
        Our team studies topography, drainage, and view corridors to help you select or prepare the perfect lot before we ever
        break ground. We also manage every review requirement, coordinating with <strong>Jefferson County</strong> and neighborhood
        HOA boards to ensure your design complies with local ordinances while still reflecting your unique architectural vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life in Vestavia Hills revolves around community, education, and family. That’s why our floor plans are created around how
        real families live—from busy school mornings to relaxed weekends at <strong>Wald Park</strong> or <strong>Vestavia City Center</strong>.
        We design intuitive spaces that flow naturally: chef-inspired kitchens that open to covered porches, walk-out basements
        perfect for play or guests, and home offices that make work-life balance easier than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a trusted <strong>Vestavia Hills custom home builder</strong>, <strong>Riveroak Building Company</strong> crafts each project
        to harmonize with the city’s scenic elevations and strong sense of place—so your home feels rooted in both design and community.

                Many Vestavia Hills properties sit on scenic ridgelines. We evaluate grading, drainage, and retaining needs early,
                partnering with civil engineers to create foundations, driveways, and outdoor living areas that feel effortless.
                Thoughtful siting preserves views while maximizing natural light and curb appeal.
