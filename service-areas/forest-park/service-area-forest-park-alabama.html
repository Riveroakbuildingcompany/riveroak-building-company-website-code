          <h2>Historic charm. Modern craftsmanship. Rooted in Birmingham.</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Tucked between Highland Avenue and Clairmont Avenue, <strong>Forest Park</strong> is one of Birmingham’s most 
          character-rich neighborhoods—celebrated for tree-lined streets, hillside views, and early 20th-century architecture. 
          From Tudor and Craftsman cottages to Mediterranean Revival estates, every home carries a story from Birmingham’s golden era.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Riveroak Building Company</strong> helps those stories continue. Whether restoring original millwork, opening a 
          kitchen for modern living, or building a new home that feels timeless from day one, our design–build approach honors Forest 
          Park’s history while creating spaces made for today.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a trusted <strong>Birmingham home builder</strong>, we coordinate with the 
          <strong>Forest Park–South Avondale Historic District</strong>, local building departments, and neighborhood associations to 
          streamline approvals and meet both historic and modern standards. Expect transparency, steady communication, and craftsmanship 
          that reflects our “Honest. Fair. Reliable.” promise.

        </div>
        <p>
          <strong>Forest Park, Birmingham, AL</strong> is more than an address—it’s a living story of architecture and community. 
          The neighborhood borders <strong>Avondale</strong>, <strong>Redmont Park</strong>, and the <strong>Highland Park Golf Course</strong>, 
          where century-old oaks shade historic homes and everyday life hums along Clairmont Avenue. From <strong>Rojo</strong> to 
          <strong>The Shops on Clairmont</strong> and <strong>Avondale Park</strong>, these landmarks reflect the charm that makes Forest Park 
          one of Birmingham’s most sought-after places to live.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a <strong>local design–build and custom home builder</strong>, Riveroak plans each project around neighborhood rhythms—considering 
          zoning nuances, limited parking, narrow streets, and community events—to keep construction respectful, efficient, and on schedule. 
          We navigate historic requirements while maintaining the serenity residents value most.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our trusted network of <strong>Birmingham artisans</strong>—metalworkers, cabinetmakers, landscape architects, and preservation 
          specialists—ensures every finish and fixture honors your home’s heritage. Whether restoring a Tudor near Highland Avenue or expanding a 
          hillside home in Redmont Park, we source authentic, enduring materials that complement Birmingham’s architectural legacy.

          <p itemprop="text">
            Homebuilding and restoration costs in <strong>Forest Park, Birmingham (35222)</strong> vary based on <strong>lot size, structural complexity, and architectural detail</strong>.
            Historic preservation requirements, custom millwork, and premium finishes can influence pricing.  
            After a design consultation and site review, we provide a <strong>clear and transparent project estimate</strong> tailored to your home’s scope and character.

        <h3 itemprop="name">Do you work with historic design guidelines or preservation boards?</h3>
        <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
          <p itemprop="text">
            Yes. Many Forest Park properties fall within <strong>design review or preservation zones</strong>, and our team regularly coordinates with 
            the <strong>City of Birmingham’s Design Review Committee</strong>. We prepare and submit architectural documentation, ensuring every project 
            aligns with the neighborhood’s historic standards while incorporating modern building performance.

        <h3 itemprop="name">Can you modernize older homes while preserving their character?</h3>
        <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
          <p itemprop="text">
            Absolutely. Our specialty lies in <strong>historic renovation and adaptive restoration</strong>—updating layouts, systems, and finishes while 
            maintaining the architectural integrity of early-20th-century homes. From <strong>kitchen redesigns and primary suite additions</strong> 
            to <strong>porch restorations and custom millwork</strong>, we balance craftsmanship with modern comfort and livability.

        <h3 itemprop="name">Do you also handle new construction in the Forest Park area?</h3>
        <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
          <p itemprop="text">
            Yes. While Forest Park is known for its historic homes, select infill lots and teardown opportunities are ideal for 
            <strong>architecturally sensitive new builds</strong>. We design and construct new residences that honor neighborhood scale, materials, and sightlines— 
            blending seamlessly among existing homes along <strong>Highland Avenue, Clairmont, and Altamont</strong>.
