    From our first conversation to move-in day, we lead with clarity and care.
    You’ll always know what’s ahead, with a committed team treating your home as
    if it were our own. Each milestone is handled with thoughtfulness and
    integrity—so the experience feels calm, guided, and genuinely rewarding.
  steps:
    - title: Initial Consultation
      description: >-
        We start with a conversation—not a sales pitch. Our goal is to understand
        your vision, timeline, and investment range so we can guide you through a
        personalized building experience from day one.
    - title: "Design & Lot Selection"
      description: >-
        Whether you already have plans or want to dream from scratch, we work
        with you to design a layout that fits your lifestyle. We can build on
        your land or help you find the perfect homesite. Every detail—from layout
        to exterior look—is customized for you.
    - title: Planning
      description: >-
        You’ll choose finishes that reflect your style, and we’ll help keep your
        vision aligned with your budget. We handle permitting, scheduling, and
        site prep so you’re never overwhelmed by red tape.
    - title: Construction Begins
      description: >-
        We combine craftsmanship and communication to bring your plans to life.

        updates and jobsite transparency you can trust.

        This is where the magic happens. After we install plumbing, electrical,
        and HVAC, your home starts to come to life with flooring, tile, cabinets,
        lighting, and all the custom touches you selected.
    - title: Final Walkthrough + Move-In

        We walk through your home together, making sure everything meets your
        expectations. A detailed punch list ensures no corners are cut, and once
        complete—you’re ready to move into a home truly built for you.
    - title: Warranty + Support
      description: >-
        We don’t disappear after closing. Our commitment to quality continues
        with post-move-in support and warranty service that gives you lasting
        peace of mind.
