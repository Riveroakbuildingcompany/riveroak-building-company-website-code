        This <strong>custom Craftsman home in Trussville, Alabama</strong> is taking shape on a wooded lot
        surrounded by tall pines — a peaceful setting that inspired its design. Built by Riveroak Building
        Company, the home blends traditional proportions with modern construction methods, using a strong
        wood frame, dimensional roofing, and a weather-protected envelope to ensure decades of durability.
    - text: >-
        Once complete, the residence will feature warm exterior materials, detailed trimwork, and a layout
        tailored to everyday family life — open gathering spaces, quiet bedrooms, and light-filled transitions
        that bring the outdoors in. Every board, beam, and finish reflects our commitment to building homes
        with soul and staying power.

  eyebrow: Trussville custom home FAQs
  heading: Frequently asked questions about building a Craftsman home in Trussville
  items:
    - question: How long does it take to build a custom Craftsman home in Trussville?
      answer: >-
        Most Riveroak Building Company projects progress from design to move-in within 10–14 months. The
        exact timeline depends on permitting, architectural complexity, and selections, but we provide
        milestone checklists and weekly updates so you always know what comes next.
    - question: Can Riveroak help with finding land or evaluating a homesite?
      answer: >-
        Yes. Our team regularly partners with local Realtors and landowners to identify the ideal site,
        review topography, and confirm utility access in Trussville and the surrounding Birmingham metro.
        We’ll walk the property with you and provide a buildability report before construction begins.
    - question: What Craftsman design details are popular with Birmingham homeowners?
      answer: >-
        Homeowners love the warmth of natural wood beams, tapered columns, and built-in cabinetry paired
        with modern conveniences like spacious pantries, covered outdoor living, and energy-efficient
        systems. Our design studio helps you personalize every finish while maintaining Craftsman
        character.
