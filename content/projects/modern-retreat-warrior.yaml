        Set along a quiet waterfront in Warrior, this property began as a wooded lot shaped by its natural slope
        and surrounding views. Before construction, Riveroak carefully prepared the land — clearing, grading,
        and orienting the foundation to follow the lake’s edge.
    - text: >-
        Every cut and contour was planned to preserve the site’s character. The layout frames open views of the
        water while maintaining privacy through elevation and landscape. This groundwork established the setting
        for a home that will feel both connected to nature and comfortably secluded.
