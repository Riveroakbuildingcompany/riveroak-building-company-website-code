        Tucked into a wooded lot in Trussville, this cottage was designed for a young family that wanted
        efficiency without compromise. Riveroak shaped a simple, smart plan beneath steep gables and dormers,
        pairing durable construction with warm, livable spaces.
    - text: >-
        Vaulted ceilings and thoughtfully placed windows pull natural light deep into the home, while tailored
        trim and durable finishes keep maintenance easy. Every square foot works hard—open where it counts,
        quiet where it matters.
