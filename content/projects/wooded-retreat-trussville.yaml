    Tucked deep into a wooded hillside, this home was built to feel peaceful, grounded, and connected to the land.
    Every choice—from the materials to the layout—was made to create a comfortable family home that feels right at home in its surroundings.

        This project sits on a private, heavily wooded lot in Trussville where the goal was simple: build a
        family home that feels both strong and peaceful. We used a mix of red brick and board-and-batten siding
        to bring warmth and texture, while keeping the design timeless and low-maintenance. The layout takes
        advantage of the slope, giving the home a walk-out lower level that opens toward the woods and connects
        indoor life with the landscape.

        One of my favorite details on this build is how it balances practicality and beauty—the detached metal
        workshop, the deep front porch, and the way natural light moves through the interior. It’s a home built
        for everyday living, done the right way.
