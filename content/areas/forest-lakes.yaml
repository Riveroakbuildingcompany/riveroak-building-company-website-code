  ## Overview

  ### Mature trees, gentle lakes, and beloved community streets.

  Forest Lakes is one of Chelsea’s most established neighborhoods. Wooded walking trails, tranquil lakes, and friendly streets create a retreat-like atmosphere within minutes of Highway 280, schools, and everyday conveniences.
