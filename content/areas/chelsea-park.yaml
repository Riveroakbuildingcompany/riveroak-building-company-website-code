  ### Embedded in Chelsea Park’s neighborhood culture and Shelby County landscape.

  Chelsea Park continues to grow with a mix of custom homes and curated spec builds. Success here demands respect for architectural covenants, stormwater design, and lot-specific grading requirements. Riveroak Building Company maintains relationships with HOA committees, local officials, and utility providers to keep your project moving smoothly while protecting the community’s aesthetics and natural resources.

  Our team also understands the lifestyle priorities that draw families to Chelsea Park—walkable schools, neighborhood events, and weekends spent fishing or kayaking on the lake. We design homes that support those rhythms with mudrooms for gear, multi-purpose bonus spaces, covered outdoor rooms, and energy-efficient systems that lower operating costs in Alabama’s climate.
