  ## Overview

  About Ballantrae

  ### Golf-course living with Southern character and modern craftsmanship.

  Ballantrae blends the natural beauty of Shelby County with an active club lifestyle. Homes overlook manicured fairways, mature hardwoods, and serene lakes, while the Ballantrae Golf Club anchors the community with social and recreational programming. Riveroak Building Company embraces that setting by shaping every residence around views, light, and livability—so mornings on the porch, afternoons on the course, and evenings with family feel effortless.

  Our design-build team manages the entire journey, from site analysis and architectural planning to budgeting, selections, and supervision. We tailor each plan to the topography of your lot, the Ballantrae design guidelines, and the way you want to live. Whether you envision a modern farmhouse with timber accents, a classic Tudor-inspired estate, or a transitional retreat with expansive glass, we coordinate engineering, permitting, and finishes with clarity and craftsmanship.

  ### Building for fairway views, forested ridges, and community standards.

  Ballantrae’s mix of golf-course frontage, hillside parcels, and wooded cul-de-sacs calls for thoughtful planning. Riveroak coordinates closely with the architectural review committee, engineers, and landscape partners to align grading, drainage, and exterior palettes with neighborhood guidelines. We evaluate sunlight, prevailing breezes, and sightlines to frame views of the course while preserving privacy from adjacent homes and cart paths.

  Inside, we consider how families gather after a round—designing open kitchens, vaulted great rooms, and terraces that connect seamlessly to outdoor living. From conditioned golf-cart garages to poolside pavilions and fire features, we tailor amenities to the way Ballantrae residents entertain and unwind. Energy-efficient systems, smart-home integration, and durable materials ensure your home performs season after season.
